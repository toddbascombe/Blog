                <p>The web celebrated its 30th anniversary this year, and what an amazing three decades they have been. We’ve seen the platform go from powering simple hypertext documents, to one that enables rich, immersive, and dynamic experiences that
                    are at the forefront of design.</p>
                <p>Looking forward, the world’s needs continue to evolve, and that motivates us to continue our participation with the global web community to adapt and improve the platform to meet the needs of the future. Our efforts are focused on making
                    the web faster and more powerful, while keeping our users’ trust and safety front and center.</p>
                <h3>Vision for an Instant Web</h3>
                <p>Speed matters on the web. We’ve found that users are highly sensitive to loading speed and this can have a direct impact on the business.</p>
                <p>So we’ve been working hard to make the browser faster and lighterso developers can do more with their experience. By focusing on startup bottlenecks, we were able to improve the loading speed on Chrome’s startup by 50% on low-end devices;
                    and 10% across devices. We also improved scrolling performance by 18% and through V8, JavaScript memory usage reduced by up to 20% for real world apps.</p>
