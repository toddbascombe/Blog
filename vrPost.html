                <p>The 2017 video from Normal VR started with an adorable, yellow, blob-like virtual avatar daintily standing in the middle of a real, physical office. Its arms waved freely through the air, painting three-dimensional flowers with an expression
                    of pure serenity on its face. As the camera panned out, a person could be seen standing next to the avatar, wearing a VR headset and waving controllers through the air. It quickly became apparent that the avatar was mirroring this
                    person’s movements, and was projected into the room by AR.</p>
                <p>This is a moment that I’ll never forget, because it was the first time I considered writing about VR and AR. To me, this video was one of the most compelling examples of how immersive technologies could work together to enable social interactions
                    across realities. It was a glimpse of the interconnected metaverse of the future. Just two years later, Normal VR is making that future a reality with an entirely remote team.</p>

                <p>The concept of remote work isn’t a new one. Telecommuting, fax machines, email, and text messaging have all been progressive steps away from the traditional office model. More recently, VR companies have caught on to the idea of professional
                    virtual environments, leveraging existing platforms or creating entirely new ones to accomplish this. I have fond memories of being a child and yelling, “It’s Texas!” whenever the fax machine would start printing.</p>
